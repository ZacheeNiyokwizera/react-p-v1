                <p> Lorem ipsum is a name for a common type of placeholder text. Also known as filler or dummy 
                    text, this is simply copy that serves to fill a space without actually saying anything meaningful.
                     It's essentially nonsense text, but gives an idea of what real words will look like in the final product.
